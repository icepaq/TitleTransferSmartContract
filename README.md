# Title Transfer Smart Contract

Why should a title be an NFT? It's a lot safer and secure to trust a smart contract to handle the exchange of the contract and money than to do it in person or via mail.

About a year ago a Bugatti Veyron was sold in an auction. The car was delivered to the new owner, however the title got lost in the mail. This caused a huge headache for the new owner and took several months to recieve a replacement title.

Although I'm sure we are VERY far away from titles being NFTs, or if it will ever happen, this is a cool example of how it could be done.
